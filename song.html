        <div class="cont">
            <div class="scrollable">
            <p>I’ve always been drawn to words—whether it’s through stories, poems, or random thoughts I jot down when inspiration strikes. But among all forms of writing, songwriting holds a special place in my heart. There’s something about turning emotions into lyrics, mixing them with melodies, and creating something that feels raw and real.<br><br>

                I like to write songs because it helps me express things I can’t always say out loud. Sometimes, feelings are too complicated to explain in a conversation, but when I put them into a song, everything just makes sense. Whether it’s happiness, heartbreak, frustration, or even just the random thoughts running through my head, songwriting gives me an outlet where I don’t have to hold back.
                
                Another reason why I love writing songs is that it lets me tell stories in my own way. I’ve always admired how music can make people feel something, even without a long explanation. A few lines, the right words, and a simple melody can already bring out emotions in ways that plain talking never could. I find that fascinating and comforting, and that’s why I keep writing—I want my songs to mean something, not just to me but maybe to someone who happens to hear them and relate.
                I want them to find comfort in the melody I created, same as how I'm relived by it, I hope my songs can touch someone's heart and soul so they may be relieved from the world's chaos.<br><br>
                
                Of course, I won’t lie—sometimes, writing songs is frustrating. There are days when the words don’t come out right, or the melody sounds off no matter what I do. But even then, I still enjoy the process. There’s a sense of freedom in knowing that I can create whatever I want, in whatever way I want it to. And when I finally get a song right, when every lyric and note just fits perfectly, it’s one of the best feelings ever.
                
                I don’t know where songwriting will take me, and honestly, I don’t really care that much about being "great" at it. I write because I love it. And as long as I have something to say, I’ll keep writing.</p>
